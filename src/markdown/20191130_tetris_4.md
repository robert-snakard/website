# Making Tetris in Rust and Wasm (Part 2)
## Concurrency, Keyboard Handling, and the Game Loop

So you’ve gotten a taste for programming? Took a bite from the power of unbounded creation and now you can’t stop? Want to learn more than just the bare minimum? Come in, come in, this is the internet, there’s always an empty seat here. We’ve got some delicious new programming concepts for you today. The first a tool wielded comedians everywhere and the second is a favorite for out of work actors: timing, and callbacks.

### 1 - Timing
Everything takes time. Your computer doesn’t display that tetris block immediately, there’s some small interval between when we call `draw_piece` and when that block prints to the screen. People take time too. There’s some small interval between when light hits our eyes and when our brain transforms that into an image, about [100 milliseconds][0] if we go from eyes closed to eyes open. Movies are filmed at [24 frames per second][1], this means our eyes can interpret up to 250ms of movement that we didn’t actually see! We’re going to run our game at [60fps][2].

![Create Game Loop](imgs/tetris_4/create_game_loop.png)

I used the `gloo-timers` crate for this part. We could use straight web-sys, Javascript does have a [set_timeout function][3] that’s [implemented by web-sys][4], but `set_timeout_with_callback_and_timeout_and_arguments_0` is really long and anyway, it’s [hard to pass functions to web-sys][5]. 

So add `gloo-timers` to your `Cargo.toml` and import it in your `src/lib.rs`. Then create a `Timeout`. Like with every crate, you can find the [documentation][6] for `gloo-timers` on [crates.io][7], the central hub for all Rust crates. Let’s take a look at the [Timeout API][8]. It takes our millisecond delay and a `FnOnce`, a Closure. 

Milliseconds is a bit of math. We want to render our game at 60 frames per second and there are 1000 milliseconds in a second. We want to call `game_loop` every 1000/60 milliseconds. Comes out to 166ms after integer division. Closure syntax in Rust is the `move || { }`, with the code you want to run stuffed in between the curly braces.

Ok - now we’ve got a 60fps game loop. Let’s do some animation.

![Animate Game Loop](imgs/tetris_4/animate_game_loop.png)

And the result

![60 FPS Tetris](imgs/tetris_4/60fps_tetris.gif)

...Way too fast and it’s this long purple line but hey, we’ve got an animation!

### 2 - Clear the board and make room for Game State
Ok let’s take another look at that gif.

![60 FPS Tetris 2](imgs/tetris_4/60fps_tetris.gif)

Ah what a beautiful gif. An elegant gif. One of those gifs that just doesn’t get old. Made using [ScreenToGif][9]. It’s got an MSI installer so you know it’s legit. `.msi` is like the Zune of installer formats. Just as legit as an iPod but nowhere near the street cred of using `apt-get install`. `.exe`s are Android.

So we’ve got two problems. The first problem is our animation moves too fast. At level 0 a Tetris piece should [fall one step every 48 frames][10] so we need to implement some kind of speed control. The second problem is the blur. We’re not erasing the old Tetris piece before drawing a new one so we just keep drawing pieces on top of each other.

![Game State](imgs/tetris_4/game_state.png)

We do a couple things here so let’s start at the top of `src/lib.rs` and work our way down. 

First is this new `GameState` struct. This is our first time using a struct so the syntax might be confusing but they’re not too complicated. Like everything else in programming, structs are there to improve our code organization. In this case we’re separating the frame count from the tetris piece’s height but we still want to group them together. We could do something like `game_loop(&mut frame_count, &mut ycoord);`. There’s nothing wrong with doing it that way, due to Rust’s focus on [zero-cost abstractions][11] both implementations are the same speed. But when we start adding the score, and the level, and the piece’s horizontal position, and all the pieces that are already on the board, well, it’s nice to have them all contained in one place. 

So after we create the GameState and pass it to the game_loop we add that speed control. I decided I wanted my tetronimo to fall once every 48 frames so we add in our limiter. If the `frame_count` is 48, move the piece down one.

How do we do that though? Well if we don’t want that blur we first we have to clear the board. I put `clear_board()` in `src/game.rs` because again, while `ctx` is an `app` concept the board is not. Also we’re using `clear_board` in conjunction with `draw_piece` and I like to group things that get used together. `clear_board` works by drawing a big black rect over everything. It’s like painting over graffiti except there’s no history to go back and look at 50 years later. 

One last thing, note the `&ctx`. This was a mistake from my last post, we should always be borrowing `ctx`. If you don’t, and try to move `ctx` instead you’ll get an error, `error[E0382]: use of moved value`. This is due to Rust’s goal of freeing memory you’re not using anymore. When you compile your code Rust tries to figure out when you’re done using a variable so it can delete it. If you let `clear_board` borrow `ctx` you’re telling the compiler “I’m still using this”, but if instead you give it to `clear_board` then `clear_board` owns it, and it can be deleted when `clear_board` is done with it. If you found this paragraph interesting you can do more research googling [Rust Lifetimes][12].

### 3 - Callbacks
Everyone loves callbacks. Call your mom on her birthday? On yours she calls you back. Find the career of your dreams? Of course you’re getting a callback. Register a `keydown` event listener then push the Right Arrow key on your keyboard? You better hope you’re getting a callback otherwise something isn’t right with your code and debugging Javascript is a fate worse than death.

![Log Event Listener](imgs/tetris_4/log_event_listener.png)

The first thing we’re going to do is create an `EventListener`. You can check out the docs for `gloo-events` [here][13], to sum up our `target` is the browser Window, our event `type` is a `keydown` event, and our callback is a closure that passes the specific event as an argument. Then we log the event.

We log the event because Javascript objects are hard. There’s a lot of documentation but a lot of it is wrong, a lot of it is out of date, and a lot of it is straight up confusing. MDN is a good bet but another easy strategy is just to print it out and let our browser do the heaving lifting for us.

![Event Listener Logged](imgs/tetris_4/event_listener_logged.png)

Opening the browser console is [different for every browser][14] but `ctrl+shift+i` works in a surprising number of cases. After viewing it you can see, keycode for an `”ArrowLeft”` string is 37, and so on. Let’s add that to our game:

![Using Key Codes](imgs/tetris_4/using_key_codes.png)

We’re finally writing that `move_piece` function. We’ll put it back in `src/game.rs` by the end of this article but it’s here for simplicity's sake. It’s much easier to show what I’m doing if I’m only working in one file.

A couple things to note. First the use of `dyn_ref` instead of `dyn_into`. If you take a look at the [gloo EventListener docs][15] you’ll see the function argument is an `&Event`, an event reference. Second is the `match`. Match is a great way to choose between lots of different options. Right now we’ve got two (plus the default) but we’ll be adding more for rotating the tetronimo and [various other features][16].

Don’t forget to add `KeyboardEvent` to your `Cargo.toml`!

### 4 - Rc, RefCell, and Fighting the Borrow Checker
We’ve got our event listener working so that’s all fine and dandy, but we still need to move the tetris piece. Let’s try what we’ve been doing:

![Shared Mut](imgs/tetris_4/shared_mut.png)

Seems like it will work but when we try to compile it 

![Compile Error](imgs/tetris_4/compile_error.png)

There’s a lot to decode here. And it’s all due to Rust’s [Ownership][17] and [Borrowing][18] rules. And a little thing called [synchronization][19].

Now I’m gonna sit ya’ll down for a little lesson in concurrency here. A little lesson in hyper-cores and multi-threading. Close your eyes, sit back, and imagine, you’ve got the number 4. It’s a nice pretty 4, all straight lines with that perfect right triangle hypotenuse to complete the package. It’s also how much money is in your bank account. Now you’re coming home from a hard day’s work and you stop by the bank to deposit your paycheck. You made $5 making [tin can telephones][20] today. At the same time your Significant Other stops by the ATM to make a withdrawal. They need $2 for some clothes. I mean yea you’ll enjoy them later but still! That’s half your paycheck and you haven’t even gotten home yet! Anyway those commands travel over the wires and reach the big bank datacenter at exactly the same time. From the north we’ve got a `-2` command and from the south west a `+5` command. Here’s the kicker though, THE COMPUTER CAN”T DO MATH IN PLACE. It has to first read the value, do the math, then put it back. 

Now nothing can happen at exactly the same time so let’s assume your deposit gets there slightly sooner. So your deposit arrives, reads the $4, then your SO’s withdrawal arrives! Your deposit hasn’t done the math yet so the withdrawal reads the $4 as well. The computer does the math and writes $9 back (because 4+5=9), but then your SO’s withdrawal does its math. Remember it also read a 4, and 4-2=2. So then the withdrawal writes $2 back where your balance goes, completely erasing the $5 you just deposited!

Yes it’s a contrived example, it’s also the [classic][21] [contrived][22] [example][23]. And it helps explain our Rust error above. We’ve got a game loop running 60 times every second and an event handler that triggers every time we hit a button. At some point there’s going to be a collision and Rust is smart enough to know that. So how do we fix it?

Well Javascript is actually [single threaded][24] and has [fake multithreading][25] so we’re gonna use [`Rc<RefCell<T>>`][26]. If we had real multithreading we’d use [`Arc<Mutex<T>>`][27].

![Ref Cell State](imgs/tetris_4/ref_cell_state.png)

Starting from the top again first we import `Rc` and `RefCell`. These are the wrapper types we’re using and it’s important to note that neither of these abstractions are zero-cost. They both have a little bit of overhead in incrementing a reference counter so we want to use as few of them as possible.

We then create a new `Rc<RefCell<GameState>>` called `state1` and we clone it. This `clone()` is [Rc’s clone][28]. Remember how we were talking about borrowing earlier? And Rust tries to figure out when it can throw away our objects? Well our problem here is we’re trying to give our `GameState` to both the event handler and the game loop. Normally you can’t do that, if some scope owns an object, another scope can’t own it as well. `Rc` is a magic workaround. Think of it like a portal. We put our GameState somewhere and wrap it up in a nice little `RefCell` box. We then create a portal to it with `Rc`. We can look through the portal, we can ask `RefCell` if we’re allowed to borrow it, we can also clone the portal. Create as many copies of this portal as we need and pass them out to whoever wants them. You still need to call `borrow_mut()` before you can access it.

So what is `borrow_mut()`? Borrow mut is part of `RefCell`’s API, and RefCell’s job is to enforce Rust’s Ownership rules at runtime (either lots of people borrow or one person borrow_muts). It’s kind of like the police, as long as your code is correct everything’s fine, but you break one rule and RefCell `panic!()`s.

![Arrow Handling](imgs/tetris_4/arrow_handling.gif)

### 5 - Organizaion and Rotation
Let’s finish up this post with a few extra features. And some code cleanup. 

![Code Cleanup](imgs/tetris_4/code_cleanup.png)

First thing we’re going to do is move `GameState` into `src/game.rs`. I mean, GameState is the definitive object of our game. If we don’t put it in the `game` module then why do we have a `game` module in the first place?

Moving GameState causes a cascading effect so that by the time our code compiles again you end up with the fully organized code above. We need some way to create a GameState object. The Rust convention is a `new()` [static method][29]. We need to make the GameState [visible][30] so we `pub` it. `game_loop()` now needs to access `GameState`’s members but [we don’t want to `pub` every member in a struct][31] so instead we move `game_loop()` to our `game` module and `pub` it. Same thing with `move_piece()`. 

Now we’re left with one last thing. Our call to `get_context()` inside the game module. We could keep it in `src/lib.rs` and pass it in to `game` as a parameter. We could keep it in `game_module()` and import our `app` module into `game`. Both cause leaking. I like to keep `lib` small so I chose to leak `app` into `game` a bit.

![Rotation Increment](imgs/tetris_4/rotation_increment.png)

If you take a look at `src/pieces.rs` we have this line `*self = match *self {`. This here assigns the result of the `match` to self and is special to Rust because [everything in Rust is an expression][32]. Every other bit of new code you’ve seen before so I’ll leave figuring it out as an exercise for the reader.
