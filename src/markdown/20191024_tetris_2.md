# Making Tetris in Rust and Wasm
## Part 1: The Tetris Video Framework
## Part 2: Importing and Exporting in Web Assembly

Welcome back readers. So you've survived the first article. Many have. Many... have not. 
This article assumes a bit of background knowledge. And a bit of intelligence on behalf 
of the reader. I will not explain what a function is, I will not explain what a variable 
is. I will not explain what it means to pass two variables as parameters when calling a 
function. If you do not understand the jargon you must learn like everyone else: using 
context clues and honing your Google-fu. Welcome to Part 2.

### 1 - A bit of history
So first, what is Web Assembly? Well actually first, what is Assembly? 
 
Assembly is the box of building blocks for code. There are lots of assembly instructions, 
each instruction does something different, each instruction is totally useless, and with 
enough of them you can build a castle. They're like the pennies of the US monetary system. 
And inflation is when you use a scripting language.

So what is web assembly? Web assembly is when a shopkeeper takes a hundred dollar bill and 
says that in his store it's only worth one cent. That was asmjs. Then someone else comes 
along, says "Hey, this is a great idea", and starts minting one cent coins that are technically 
worth $100 but then aren't because the economy fluctuates. That's web assembly. 

So to sum up: 
-  Programming languages all compile to assembly eventually
-  Javascript is a giant, ugly, bloated scripting language
-  [Some geniuses][1] decide the best way to fix this is to create javascript versions of every 
assembly instruction
-  [Lots of languages][2] make modifications so they can compile to asmjs
-  [Web browsers decide][3] "hey, why use javascript as a middle man?"
-  I get yelled at because my analogy is wrong in every way

### 2 - Your build environment
Ah yes, everybody's favorite part. Configuring your build environment. If you've done this 
before this part's fun! There are so many shells to choose from, editors to choose from, 
editor themes to choose from. If you're new it's a lot of useless information. They all claim 
to be different, they all claim to be the best, they're all liars. Except Vim. Vim really is 
the best. Vimming is like swimming or riding a bike. It's painful to learn but it's a skill 
everyone should have. I recommend [this Hacker News comment by Sevensor][4].

The following section is a lot of information in a small space. Read everything twice before doing 
it yourself and please email me if something is confusing.   - Robert

Alright, so I've decided on [my text editor][5], there's also [Atom][6], [SublimeText][7], [Notepad++][8], 
and a [host of others][9], Now on to your shell. I'm using the [Ubuntu install][10] for [Windows Subsystem for 
Linux][11]. There's also git bash, and if you're on OSX or Linux you can just use your terminal 
app. Choose one.

Now let's [install Rust][12]. Open your shell and paste `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf 
https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`. Read everything that prints to the screen, it will tell you 
how to uninstall if you want to start over. Now close and open your shell again to quickly 
source your `~/.profile`.

Now let's [create][13] a [Github][14] (if you haven't already) and [set up your ssh keys][15].
Create a repo [\[no readme\]][16] named [`${USERNAME}.github.io`][17]. This sets up Github Pages 
so you can view your website online. You can also use [Netlify][18] or [Heroku][19].

Now familiarize yourself with some [beginner bash commands][20]. Then [navigate to your home 
directory][21] and `mkdir` a project folder. We've got some initialization to do.

![initialization step]("imgs/tetris_2/initialization_step.png")

Note: I linked my project folder to the Desktop behind the scenes. You can do the same 
with `ln -s /mnt/c ~/Desktop` 

Ok, so this is our initialization step. After creating our project folder we create a 
new Rust project using Cargo. Why is it called Cargo and not Rust? Copyright reasons. 
Next we install the web assembly (wasm) compilation target using Rustup. Why Rustup and 
not Cargo? Territorial dispute. 

Now we'll create our first git commit. First initialize the project folder as a git repository. 
Why does it say "Reinitialized" instead of "Initialized"? Cause Cargo interacts with git under 
the hood. Then add the `.gitignore`, add the files not ignored, and commit with a message. 

This is a local commit. It's not pushed to Github yet.   
See, Git's designed to work in a nuclear apocalypse, so until we use `git remote` your 
repository is completely independent from all networks. So grab the [SSH link][22] for your 
remote repository and `git remote add origin` so we can push our commit. Now open `Cargo.toml`.

![edit Cargo.toml](imgs/tetris_2/edit_cargo.png)

We didn't change too much. Just added the `[lib]` and `["cdylib"]` lines. See, when we 
compile we want our package to be a "C dynamic library", a `cdylib`. We want that because 
we need our library to be compatible with WASM and as a rule of thumb, C is compatible 
with everything.

![commit cargo changes](imgs/tetris_2/commit_cargo.png)

Here we commit our change to Cargo.toml.

This is your basic git workflow. `git add` all the files you changed, `git commit -m` your 
changes, then `git push` your new commits. There's also `git reset` to un-add a file, 
`git diff` to view your un-added changes, and `git log` to view your history.

Now create a file `index.html`, save, and commit it to test if your github.io works. You 
can see my [last post][23] for an example skeleton.

### 3 - Rust and Wasm 
Alright you made it! It's time to get started with web assembly! Open up `src/lib.rs` and 
`index.html` It's time for some double text editing action!

![edit lib.rs](imgs/tetris_2/edit_lib.png)

Here's our first bit of Rust. We create a test module and a function that asserts 2 + 2 
does equal 4. Now lets run the test.

![cfg test](imgs/tetris_2/cfg_test.png)

Now I got a warning cause `Desktop` is uppercase. I'll fix that later. Let's focus on the 
two new objects. Cargo.lock is generated from Cargo.toml, you can ignore it. `target` on 
the other hand, has all of our compiled binaries and will become very important as we 
compile our Wasm.

![edit lib.rs 2](imgs/tetris_2/edit_lib_2.png)

Now I've added a function called `two_plus` that takes in an integer and returns an integer. 
Specifically it returns the original number plus 2. I also deleted the line that segregated 
modules. I'll explain them at another time.

![cfg test 2](imgs/tetris_2/cfg_test_2.png)

Congratulations! Once yours passes the test you've successfully written your first Rust 
code! Are you ready for some wasm?

![edit lib.rs 3](imgs/tetris_2/edit_lib_3.png)

Ok so first things first in the `src/lib.rs`, we added `#[no_mangle]` and made two\_plus 
a public function. These are both very important for the compiler. `pub` means public. 
It exports the function. Without it, `two_plus` wouldn't appear in `obj.instance.exports`. 
`no_mangle` is a command. It stops the compiler from mangling.

Now what is mangling? Time for another history lesson. People have been writing code for a 
while now. There's a lot of code out there. And as much as we like to think we're all random 
and original, we're not. There are probably hundreds of programs out there with a function 
named two\_plus (although actually there aren't, I checked). So if I import two programs 
that export a two\_plus function what happens? Things break. So instead one program exports a
`_RN15mycrate_4a3b56d3two_plusFE` and the other exports a `_JX17othercrate_e36ce00ctwo_plusAB`. 
There's an entire scheme.

Ok. So. This is kinda out of order but let's look at the `index.html` side. We added some 
script tags. The first line imports our wasm (`./` for current directory, `desktop.wasm` 
cause that's my project name). After that we call our WASM function! obj because it's a 
wasm object, instance cause the other choice is module but we put all our functions in 
instance, exports cause that holds our exports, then two_plus, our function! We'll then 
call `alert` so we get a message saying it worked. Now to compile.

![cfg test 3](imgs/tetris_2/cfg_test_3.png)

Remember how I said `target` was going to be important later? Well it's important now. 
First we're going to `cargo build` to compile, and specify that wasm32 target we installed 
earlier with rustup. Then we need to go find it. The binary. Open your `target` directory 
and look for the folder `wasm32`. Cargo compiles in debug mode by default so you'll find 
your binary there but you can set the `--release` flag if you want.

Anyway copy your binary to `./${NAME}.wasm` then commit and push to github.io. Tada!
