# Making Tetris in Rust and Wasm Part 1
## The Tetris Video Framework Part 1
## HTML, Javascript, and the CanvasRenderingContext{.subsubheading}

Note: This post ended up a lot longer than I intended so I've split it
in to two articles. They're still written as if they're one article.
Keep that in mind. {.note}

Since the dawn of time people have been making flash games. [In 1995][1] 
classicgames.com made its way on to the world stage with the classics:
Solitaire, Freecell, Checkers, Chess, Poker. [Newgrounds followed][2] in 
1997 with its classics: Club a Seal, Assassin, Three Foot Ninja. Now 
flash is dead, burned to dust by the likes of Mozilla Firefox and 
Google Chrome and a new hero is rising. HTML5 and the \<canvas\> element.
Joined by Rust and WebAssembly I will use these tools to create... 
a complete game of Tetris. {.intro}

In this post I take a look at the canvas element, Rust/WASM compilation,
and embedding a WASM applet in JS. Follow me on my journey to learn the 
ins and outs of the Modern Day Flash Game.{.intro}

### 1 - Lets start at the very beginning
Like everything in this too-much-information age it's often difficult
to know where to start. There are so many tutorials out there that all 
start differently and teach you different things. Below I've listed 
some of the ones I read. We'll start at the very beginning, with a 
file.

<http://www.chinedufn.com/3d-webgl-basic-water-tutorial/>
<https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/>
<https://www.pmg.com/blog/my-firsthand-experience-with-rust-webassembly/>
<https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9t95fd/howto_setting_up_webassembly_on_stable_rust/>
<https://dev.to/dandyvica/wasm-in-rust-without-nodejs-2e0c>

And now the file:   
![Computer desktop showing blank html document named 'index.html'](imgs/initial_file.png "Initial File")   
Create a file `index.html` and open it up in your favorite text editor
![Notepad++ showing the skeleton index.html with an h1 tag: 'Tetris'. See the github commit titled 'Empty Index' for the source](imgs/empty_index.png "Empty Index")   
Start with a basic HTML skeleton. There are better ones out there.
You can tell me about them in the comments. For now we're using this 
skeleton. It has a doctype and two meta tags. 

The doctype is important. It tells your web browser what kind of 
document you have. It's also vestigial. You'll always use the HTML5
`!doctype html`. You can view the official list of other doctypes [here][3].

The two meta tags are also important. The charset tag guarantees your 
fonts are rendered correctly eg when using emoji or Mandarin. The 
viewport tag is important due to the wide range of device sizes in 
today's world. Notice how my blog renders on mobile without the need 
for a separate mobile site. I got these from <https://htmlhead.dev>.

Now open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
![Screenshot of index.html open in firefox. "Tetris" is displayed on the page](imgs/skeleton_firefox.png "Skeleton Firefox")   
If yours doesn't look like mine you did something wrong. Look at your 
code, compare it to mine, do some research, browse Stack Overflow. 
If nothing's working feel free to email me or comment below.

### 2 - A very good place to start

Now we're gonna take a look at some javascript, some graphics, and compile our first wasm.   
![index.html with a canvas element. See github commit titled 'Start 2' for the source](imgs/start_2.png "Start 2")   
First make your webpage look like mine. We've added a title and an icon, 
a canvas, and a link to this blog. 

The title is simple. It's the name of your webpage. You can see it at 
the top there next to the `favicon.ico`. It says "Tetris" instead of
"index.html". To generate the favicon head to head over to a favicon 
generator, I used <favicon.io>.

Next is the canvas element. Unlike many elements it's got its own width 
and height attributes (usually you'll control an object's size with the 
`style` tag). This is because canvas is a rendering element, it's our 
graphics bread and butter. Style is applied as a final touch of displaying 
a web page and canvas needs to have its width and height available for 
its computations. Speaking of computations, check out the [canvas MDN 
page][4] for more canvas guides, tutorials and libraries and look at the 
javascript below.   
![index.html after adding some javascript to draw a rectangle on our canvas element. See github commit titled 'Javascript 1' for the source](imgs/javascript_1.png "Javascript 1")   
First thing we did was add some script tags so we can write some javascript. 
These can go anywhere and you'll often see them in the `head` so they don't 
ruin formatting. Next thing we did was get our canvas. [`getElementsByTagName`][5] 
will return every canvas element in the `document` (on the page). We only 
have 1 canvas element so we know our canvas element will be the 0th item 
in the returned list. We use it to get our rendering context.

The rendering context is what we use to draw to the screen. We're using the 
2d rendering context but therer are also the [bitmap and webgl2 contexts][6] 
available. The 2d rendering context has some basic built in drawing 
functions. Similar to the tools you'd find in Paint rather than Illustrator 
or Photoshop. Speaking of though, there are some vector graphics functions 
like [Arc][7], [LineTo][8], and [BezierCurveTo][9]. 

We drew a rectangle.   
![index.html after adding more javascript that adds text to our canvas element. See github commit titled 'Javascript 2' for the source](imgs/javascript_2.png "Javascript 2")   
And added some text.
![A HAL9000 replica drawn entirely in javascript. See github commit 'HAL9000' for the source](imgs/hal9000.png "HAL9000")   
Draw the rest of the fucking owl.

### 3 - Rust and Web Assembly
So yea, I did an art project instead of finishing up this article. It
_was_ getting really long though and I _was_ going to have to split it into
3 movies anyway, so goodbye, Here's a picture of a cat.
