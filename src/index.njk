<h2>Making Tetris in Rust and Wasm (Part 1)</h2>
<p>Like everything in this too-much-information age it's often difficult to know where 
to start. There are so many tutorials out there that all start differently and teach 
you different things. Below I've listed some of the ones I read. We'll start at the very 
beginning, with a file.</p>

<p>Ah yes, everybody's favorite part. Configuring your build environment. There are so 
many shells to choose from, editors to choose from, editor themes to choose from. If

<h2>Making Tetris in Rust and Wasm (Part 3)</h2>
<p>We’re finally starting our project now. We’ve done the background research. We know

<p>People take time too. There's some small interval between when light hits our eyes and when our brain 
transforms that into an image, about 100 milliseconds if we go from eyes closed to eyes open. Movies 
are filmed at 24 frames per second, this means our eyes can interpret up to 250ms of movement that we 
didn't actually see! We're going to run our game at 60fps.</p>
